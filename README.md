# 3D Printer SD Card Fixer

MacOS app to fix the SD card issues and annoyances with OSX and Dremel's 3D printer 3D20

### What does it do?

* Removes the annoying .-NameOfYourFile files
* Removes al the files with ".gcode" extention
* Safely eject the SD card

### Getting Started

### Download the latest version

Download the latest version of the "3D Printer SD Card fixer" here

### Install it

Just drag and drop it to your applications folder

### Run it

Double click it, it will ask you for the name of your SD card, I recommend to name it:
```
Dremel_3D20
```
So you no longer need to write the name and just click enter as soon as you open it.

That's it! The SD card should be clean for the archive system of the Dremel's 3D20 main board. Happy printing!

## About me

My name is César Millán, i'm a Biomedical Engineer from México, i have been in the 3D printer community since 2015 and my first and most used machine is my Dremel 3D20 with more than 4000 hours it has a lot of modifications but the main board is still the same because I like the touchscreen interface but it can be really annoying with the OSX file system so i decided to create this app to make my (and hopefully others) life easier. 

### Want to buy me some beer?

Any tips are welcome to help me find spaces and write helpful apps for the 3D printing community.
